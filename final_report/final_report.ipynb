    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight delays are a consistent challenge in U.S. air travel, disrupting passenger itineraries and reducing airline operational efficiency. This project develops predictive and classification models to estimate the magnitude of departure delays for American domestic flights, leveraging large-scale datsets from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for flight operations and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for historical weather records, with data spanning 2015-2019. The prediction task is limited to information available two hours prior to a given flight's scheduled departure, to ensure applicability in real world scenarios. Delays are defined as departures 15 minutes or more behind schedule, with predictions focusing on estimating delay as a continuous target variable as well as classification of major delay events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using PySpark on Databricks, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify temporal, spatial, and operational trends in delay patterns. Using these insights, we engineered targeted features spanning weather conditions, carrier performance, traffic patterns, and network connectivity metrics. All engineered features were constrained to the 2 hour prediction window, and time dependent aggregates were calculated based on historical information to preserve temporal relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated a wide range of modeling approaches, including logistic & linear regression, elastic net, random forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, ensemble frameworks, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Ensemble methods and neural networks consistently yielded the strongest performance. These models were trained and validated using a time series cross validation, with a final evaluation conducted on the year 2019 to avoid any temporal violations. Both classification and regression approaches were chosen to support one another and provide independent results if either was more desirable based on the business use case. Future work could include leveraging the results of the classification model to feed into the regression model, which we anticipate will enhance our model performance greatly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performance was assessed using multiple metrics: mean absolute error (MAE) for intepretability, root mean squared error (RMSE) for penalizing large errors, and R squared in a limited fashion for variance explanation. Classification models also used appropriate metrics such as recall, F1 score, precision, and ROC/PR area under curve (AUC). This combination provided a holistic view of predictive quality, avoiding possible misinterpretation from a single metric evaluation. Preliminary results indicate that the extensive feature engineering meaningfully improves overall model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating scalable big data-processing with carefully engineered models, our work demonstrates the potential for near real-time delay forecasting, offering actionable insights to improve passenger planning and airline operational decision making. "

    "##Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute error (MAE): measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, without considering direction, meaning that positive and negative errors are treated equally due to the absolute value aspect of this metric. It is more robust to outliers than metrics which square errors, such as RMSE, making it a great compliment to metrics of that nature so we can provide a holistic evaluation of our models. It is easily interpretable since the result is in the same units as the predicted variable dep_delay (minutes) and can be use across a variety of different models for facilitated comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left|y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**  \n",
    "$$n = \\text{number of observations}$$  \n",
    "$$y_i = \\text{actual value for the $i^{th}$ observation}$$  \n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_i = \\text{predicted value for the $i^{th}$ observation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Root mean squared error (RMSE): measures the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. This metric penalizes large errors more heavily because the errors are squared before averaging, making it sensitive to outliers. For this reason, it can be useful in specific problems such as this where we want to mark large delays as especially detrimental. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2}\n",

    "$$\\hat{y}_i = \\text{predicted value for the $i^{th}$ observation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared: measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It evaluates how well the model's predictions fit the actual data, and ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being a perfect fit. This metric was used sparingly since it is best suited for linear models, but nonetheless, helped create a complete picture for proper evaluation in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",

    "#### Classification\n",

    "Accuracy: measures the proportion of total predictions that the model correctly classifies. It is easily understood and intuitive, making it a great classification metric that can be widely applicable. \n",

    "$$FN = \\text{False Negatives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct. It answers the question of, when the model predicts positive, how many are actually correct? It is quite useful for this context when false positives can be costly, such as predicting a delay when a given flight is actually on time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",

    "**Where:**  \n",
    "$$TP = \\text{True Positives}$$  \n",
    "$$FP = \\text{False Positives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics. By summarizing two metrics in a single measure, F1 is robust to imbalance and provides a complete picture when neither precision or recall fully can. \n",

    "Area Under ROC Curve (AUC): measures a model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes across all classification thresholds.

    "**Formula**\n",

    "At a high level, flight data can be duplicative in nature due to the re-entry of data using the same tail number upon arrival and departure. While humans understand the difference, depending on the joins used and data extraction, this can be seen as a duplicate given the same tail number is present in two or more rows, with similar accompanying flight data. High duplicates in the flight data confirm this suspicion, and the diminished duplicate quantity in OTPW suggests there was handling to address this issue through the join that created the OTPW dataset. The major outlier (in a good way) here is the full OTPW dataset which contains 0 duplicates. This suggests that a dedeuplication step was run after the join, maybe using dropDuplicates() on key identification columns (`FL_DATE`, `TAIL_NUM`, `ORIGIN`, etc.). Or the join logic was completely refined for the full 60 month dataset here. \n"

    "Before data pre-processing, most of the nulls in the data appear on the weather-side; which for the most part seems related to either lack of weather status, were not reported at all, or faulty/troublesome machinery at the time of reporting. Nearly all nulls associated within flight specific information are related to flight being cancelled, thereby not being able to produce specific time based metrics such as taxi times, departure and arrival times, air travel time, etc. Subanalysis was perfomed on airport level, if the appearance of cancelled flight per date makes a substantial impact on the flight delays per those airports and the results showed that average/median delays at airport level remained relatively consistent regardless of a cancellation; however, further processes need to be defined to understand if a cancellation impacts subsequent use of the `TAIL_NUM` aircraft throughout the remainder of its given travel \"leg\". Additionally, subanalysis was performed in the types of cancellations between assigned `TAIL_NUM` and unassigned `TAIL_NUM` flights to see if perhaps one type of cancellation provides broader implication of delays per date at the airport level; although, airport flight with assigned `TAIL_NUM` produced more extreme delays the overall median and dispersion of delays at the airport level remained relatively consistent, as highlighted below.

    "Exploring the differences and similarities across the datasets is crucial to understand the variation in outcomes when looking at model results. Here we view the average ARR_DELAY (arrival delay) and DEP_DELAY(departure delay) across the 3 different OTPW and flights datasets. Departure delays, shown in blue, are consistently higher than arrival delays in all datasets. This suggests that flights could make up some time in the air, decreasing the average arrival delay. The 1 year flight dataset has the highest average departure delay around 11 minutes, while both the 3 month datasets have the highest arrival delay around 6 minutes. In general, the datasets have very similar delays across the same time frames. We see some differences likely due to the joins used to create the OTPW dataset, but overall, this shows good consistency that we hoped for. \n",

The suspicion is captured addtional extended the window too much for non-impact holidays like President's Day or Memorial Days that may actually be reducing the average holiday delays since people are not likely to fly a week before or after. Also, we are potentially missing key dates like Summer Vacation, Spring Break, college student return to home or school, etc. Therefore, for the further pipelines and time being, we are limiting to within three days in our pipeline until we can better redefine \"holiday travel\" in a meaningful way. Also of note, days surrounding holidays tend to see a greater increase in departure delays than the holiday itself. \n",

    "In the opening phases of this project, our group strongly believed that weather would be a key factor in delay prediction. In fact, one of our group members experienced a weather delay in our first week of working together. Through some additional research, we uncovered a report from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which cited that 74.26% of flight delays between June of 2017 and May of 2023 were caused by weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our initial analysis of our own datasets, we uncovered that relatively few delayed flights cited weather as the primary reason for delay. Over the entire on-time performance dataset, running from 2015 to 2019, we found that only 1-2% of flights were weather delayed. That being said, we believe that the ripple effects possible from weather delays could have significant effects on subsequent flights, and we elected to proceed with our attempts to use weather information in delay prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could do so, we ran additional EDA on the weather variables available to us in our primary dataset. We began by taking a look at the distribution of weather variables. Our data included information about air temperature, dew point, precipitation, wind speed, visibility, and humidity. Below is a look at the distribution of each of these variables.\n",

    "While the overall number of delays due to weather was low, we speculated that there may be seasonal or geographic trends that affect the percentage of weather delays in the dataset. Consistent with our expectations, we saw trends in both seasonality and region. \n",

Considering the differences in the types of weather events that these regions experience, let's take a look at seasonal trends to determine if certain types of weather events are more likely to cause delays.\n",

    "Here, we can see that there were a greater number of flights in the spring and summer months than the fall or winter months. Importantly, we can also see that flights during the summertime were the most likely to be delayed for weather conditions at 1.41%.

Upon further investigation, it would appear that a significantly lower percentage of flights may have been delayed due to weather conditions in 2016 because of the lack of extreme/severe weather events that took place in that year. The National Weather Service lists only four severe weather events in 2016: three of which were tornados and one was heavy rain. Conversely, 2017 saw several hurricanes and tropical storms. While this would suggest that there should be a higher percentage of weather-delays, that is not what we see in our graph, however, it is important to note that these severe weather events likely resulted in a greater number of cancellations, which would not appear as weather delays in our dataset.\n"

    "## Creating “Adverse Weather” Variable and Generating Predictions for Departure Time\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make use of the weather data available and prevent leakage, we initially planned to predict whether there would be adverse weather two hours before each flight’s scheduled departure time. This would eventually enable us to feed our adverse weather prediction into our downstream delay prediction model without fear of our model peeking into the actual weather conditions at departure time. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this phase in our project, we elected to create a proof of concept model to determine how likely we were to be able to accurately predict adverse weather conditions based on the information available to us. This would be an isolated experiment, using slightly different strategies than our other engineered features, with the plan to eventually make modifications to this procedure and add this model into our larger feature engineering pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we elected to use a single year of data, from both our joined dataset and our isolated weather dataset. We worked under the assumption that a single year would be enough data to encapsulate seasonal trends, but would allow us to work more quickly than working with the entire corpus of data available to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "We proceeded with the year 2019, and began by preparing our joined dataset to only include necessary columns to be used as keys for individual flights. We kept columns such as tail number, carrier, and origin airport, as well as the “two hours prior” and scheduled departure timestamps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we built our weather features. We began by identifying the roughly 300 stations in our dataset that contained flight information, and then inner-joined the full weather dataset to those stations, dropping the other 95% of records in the weather dataset immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cast relevant fields to numeric and handled null values. In this case, we elected to use mode imputation for null observations at any station that reported weather data, working under the assumption that, for any station that had non-null values in its dataset, the null values represented the standard state (i.e., no precipitation, clear visibility, no wind, etc.). If a station contained no weather observations, this station was dropped from this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we generated a binary “adverse_weather” variable at each hour. This variable serves as a simplistic indicator of whether or not a station was observing adverse weather at each hour. We generated this variable using a data-driven approach: for all flights in the dataset that were delayed due to weather conditions, we took the upper-percentiles of the weather states that were occurring. For example, we took the 90th percentile of precipitation and wind gusts from those observations, as well as the 75th percentile of wind speed. If an observation in the dataset cleared any of the thresholds we were using, we were said to have adverse weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also took a critical step to prevent leakage in this model’s prediction: creating lagged variables. We generated lagged features 1-4 hours prior to the prediction (3-6 hours before scheduled departure). As an additional check, we dropped any flights from this dataset that lacked lagged variables after said variables were created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our features were built for adverse weather prediction, we moved onto splitting the data. We parsed our scheduled departure timestamps into epoch seconds, and used this to find the 75th-percentile cutoff for our 2019 dataset.

    "\n",
    "At this point, we immediately realized that incorporating the predicted variables into our pipeline was far more complex than we had anticipated. Questions arose around when the predictions would be made, how we would handle predictions for weather versus predictions in the overall delay-prediction models, and whether there might be a more straightforward solution that could yield results that were as strong, or even better, than the proposed multi-stage process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the issue, and ultimately elected to move away from the predicted “adverse weather” solution entirely. We did, however, think that we had uncovered a way to incorporate weather into our feature engineering process during the development of the initial weather prediction models: lagged variables and an “adverse weather” flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceeded with a slightly altered approach to generating these variables. We used the supplementary weather dataset made available to us by NOAA, and pulled observations of weather variables between two and six hours before each flight’s scheduled departure time. Taking the first observation at each “station hour” during this time range, we were able to trace weather patterns in the hours leading up to prediction (two hours ahead of scheduled departure).\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied similar preprocessing as before:\n",
    "- For simplicity, we only looked at stations with associated flight data in our primary dataset instead of attempting to create a more complete mapping from nearby stations.\n",
    "- We used mode imputation to address scenarios in which “standard” weather conditions were included as null values at stations that regularly reported weather data. This means that, for any included station with non-null values in the weather-related fields, null values were replaced with zeros for fields such as precipitation and wind, or with ten for fields like visibility. \n",
    "- Finally, we elected to drop outliers that exceeded the 99.9th percentile in columns such as precipitation and wind speed, as these values appeared to be the result of recording errors (appeared higher than realistically possible, rainfall of hundreds of inches in an hour, or wind speeds of thousands of miles per hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this pre-processing was complete and the lagged variables were created, this process was built into a self-contained function and incorporated into our feature engineering pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the lagged variables, we created an “adverse weather” flag at the time of prediction. This binary variable was constructed using the tuned thresholds that we had found during our weather prediction development, but this time, the variable was based on conditions two hours prior to each flight’s scheduled departure time.\n",
    "\n",

    "We primarily focused on opportunities to generate more sophisticated features that were based directly on flight and airport data. All features were time filtered to avoid the previously mentioned constraints around data leakage. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flights were joined by their tail number to the most recent preceding flight and we then extracted the preceding flight's arrival delay, departure delay, and time from arrival to scheduled departure of current flight. Previous flight arrival delay would be an ideal piece of information to have but is usually not available, whereas previous departure delay is. Since they are so closely correlated (Pearson's r of ~0.96), we have opted to use the previous departure delay. This would correspond to a given flight not being able to compensate much for a delay in departure by speeding up in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We also gathered delay and time gap values for the flight before the preceding one, with a similar rationale/method as described above. The motivation for this was to capture any longer-term relationships around propagating delays as opposed to simply examining delays one flight into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We generated new columns around the scheduled departure time of the next flight as well as the time gap between that and the scheduled arrival of the current flight. The rationale was that airlines might be likely to deprioritize the current flight when there is a bottleneck and the next flight has a lot of slack built in (i.e. a planned delay would not be likely to cause downstream delays).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scheduled departure times were converted from HHMM format to a minutes only format to generate a proper numeric variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphs were generated on a monthly basis, with airport codes represented by nodes and the reciprocal of flight count on a given route forming edge weights. This created a network that would have lower weights on higher volume routes. Shortest path algorithms would get routed through higher volume routes preferentially. This way when we calculated centrality measures, the airports that act as hubs would get labeled with higher centrality. The features for any given flight were derived from the previous slice in time so that there would be no inclusion of information that wouldn't be present at the time of prediction. The centrality metrics we will be experimenting with are Betweenness, Degree, and Closeness centrality. They will be encoded as features for both the origin and destination airport for each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interaction features were explored between high ranking features that are not correlated (simple products) but they were not found to increase model performance in any noticeable way. This is likely because the model architectures themselves often have the capacity to learn these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Airports visited by a given plane through the span of the dataset were also calculated . This would directly correspond to the diversity of routes a given plane has seen, and might imply something about changing staff, maintenance concerns, or logistical changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neighboring airports of the origin are also being counted. The thought process here is that a nearby airport could cause crowding of airspace and contribute to delays. The current radius we're using for this feature is 100 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flights are evaluated to see if they fall within 3 days of an official holiday. The thinking here is that the holidays could cause increased flight volume and delays could propagate through the system at a greater rate with the reduced slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are also modeling the relative age of each plane based on its first flight in the dataset. Using this, we are also calculating the rate of utilization in its lifespan within the scope of the dataset utilizing lagged statistics. Utilization could correspond to trends around maintenance concerns, which are often causes of delays when done on an impromptu basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are looking at flagging flights that are scheduled to take off on the same day and time with the same tail number. This is because cancellations with a given plane are still reported, even when they are repurposed for a different destination. We are considering these to be \"redirected\", which could have implications around logistical readiness (eg a flight moved to a new route might need some time to confirm details for the new route).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative airport traffic is being modeled by taking the flight count at the origin airport on the previous day and then dividing by the average daily flight count of the airport for the previous calendar month. The thought here is that surges in airport traffic could strain logistics and cause systematic delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we are also taking counts of flights going to the same destination that were cancelled or diverted (separate counts/features for each) in the 2-8 hours before the current flight. This could create some signal around weather or other logistical patterns on routes that share proximity.\n"

There are diminishing returns after PC4 which is known as an 'elbow pattern' around PC3-PC5. The top 10 PCs shown here account for ~85% of the variance which is great dimensionality reduction from our original 22 feature input list (shown below). This shows great promise that most of the meaningful signal can be compressed into fewer dimensions than we have from our raw data. We can combine redundant or noisy features, and potentially replace original features with fewer principal components without sacrificing predictive power. In regard to our regression model, we can reduce overfitting by reducing dimensions, and stabilize our generalization by decreasing variance in our model. This is a great and crucial step toward enhancing our model performance. \n",

    "Delay detection via classification was conducted as an initial filter of sorts, to help operations focus only on flights that were considered 'at risk'. While the regression modeling that follows can predict delay as a continuous variable, classification serves a broader purpose of simply alerting fliers and airline carriers whether a given flight will be delayed: yes or no. To build on that, we developed regression models to quantify the severity of these delays. We can combine the work from both approaches to provide a complete, robust solution and answer to flight delays. Imagine we take a single flight, from JFK to SFO, we can use the classifier to initially understand if we can expect a delay at all, and if there is, then we can invoke our regression model to quantify the delay. They work hand in hand but can also operate independently, showing the power of each. "

    "We began with some standard preprocessing on our complete dataset, now including our complete set of engineered features. At this stage, we dropped any rows that still contained missing values, filtered out cancelled/diverted flights, and created a binary “label = 1” if the departure delay was greater than 15 minutes. We also cast numeric and binary columns from strings to doubles, and performed our train/test split in a way to account for leakage, assigning all years prior to 2019 as the training dataset, and 2019 as the test set. \n",

We first handled class imbalance by applying inverse-frequency class weights (w₀≈1.25 for on-time, w₁≈5.07 for delayed) and trained a weighted model. We then ran a 3-fold cross-validation grid over the regularization settings and found the best parameters to be regParam = 0.001 and elasticNetParam = 1.0 (pure L1). Next, we swept decision thresholds from 0.30 to 0.70 and chose 0.60 because it gave the highest F1 on the 2019 test set.

    "The random forest model performs above average at best, but shows great promise from initial experimentation. Precision is observed to be low at the default threshold of 0.5, meaning many on time flights are incorrectly classified as delayed. While this dataset is already massive, having more data to feed the model will only facilitate model classification. Threshold optimization will help us mitigate the cost benefit tradeoffs between missed delays and false alarms. Feature enrichment such as the addition of high resolution weather, live traffic load, and other artificially generated features can help guide our model. Finally, we have discussed the idea of using segmented models, which include training specialized models per airline carrier, route category, or location to capture local delay dynamics.  "

The model configuration was built using hidden layer sizes of (64,32) ReLU activation, adam optimizer, and early stopping, overall a small and fast baseline. Despite this, MLPs are computationally exhaustive and this model took a whopping 32 minutes to execute.

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show clear signal for classification. Random Forest leads with AUC 0.8249 and F1 0.7573, and tuned Logistic Regression follows closely at AUC 0.7893 and F1 0.7444. The CatBoost classifier underperforms these two, and the deep classifier’s high accuracy with very low recall (0.7933 vs 0.0831) confirms that default thresholding on an imbalanced label is not usable without calibration. In short, classification is learnable and robust today using RF or a calibrated LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression tells a different story. Simple baselines anchor RMSE near 49–51 on test. XGBoost improves MAE to 15.94 but posts negative R² (−0.0218), which means squared errors still exceed the variance of the target. CatBoost delivers the only positive R² (0.1080) yet with higher RMSE and MAE, trading typical error for modest variance explanation. The MLP achieves the lowest RMSE (43.81) with MAE 17.54. These patterns are consistent with heavy-tailed misses: average absolute error can drop while a few large residuals keep R² flat or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature-importance analysis shows signal is mostly driven by turnaround and propagation, not raw weather. The top factors are the time between inbound arrival and scheduled departure, previous departure delay, and a second-leg turnaround proxy, indicating delays cascade across legs when buffers are tight. Recent destination disruptions (cancellations and diversions in the prior 2–6h) rank just below these, showing network conditions at the destination affect outcomes even before pushback. For regression, the same pattern explains tail risk: when propagation and rare disruptions spike, squared errors jump; reducing tail impact will likely require better features for extreme events and airport capacity, not just more model depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the decision is binary triage, alerts, or SLA gating, classification is ready for production. Random Forest is the best default, with Logistic Regression as a simpler calibrated fallback. Both models show balanced precision and recall at the reported operating point, which aligns with operational needs. If the decision requires a magnitude forecast, regression can help, but only under explicit constraints. Use the MLP where the KPI is RMSE and downstream processes tolerate occasional large misses. Use CatBoost when stakeholders require non-trivial explained variance, accepting higher typical error.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We set out to predict flight delays in time to help operations triage risk and set expectations. This matters because even modest gains in early warning reduce missed connections, crew knock-ons, and customer impact. Our target was a 2-hour pre-departure decision. At T-2 hrs the dominant drivers appear to be inbound delay propagation, turnaround buffers, and very recent destination disruptions. Large, weather-driven or air-traffic-driven delays often crystallize inside this window, which explains why classification is reliable while magnitude prediction remains difficult to capture. These results therefore match the operational reality of the horizon we chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, teams should pair the model with live reporting and qualitative signals that are not fully captured numerically. Examples include dispatcher or station alerts, gate and crew availability notes, maintenance status, ground holds, and very short-horizon weather updates. This hybrid approach preserves the model’s early-warning value while accounting for on-the-ground factors that shift quickly in the last two hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification worked well. Random Forest led (AUC 0.8249, F1 0.7573) with calibrated Logistic Regression close behind. These models offer balanced precision and recall without complex tuning. Regression was harder. The MLP delivered the lowest RMSE (43.81) but models struggled with explained variance and large outliers; CatBoost was the only regressor with positive R² (0.108). Across models, the strongest features were operational: time between inbound arrival and scheduled departure, previous-leg delay, short-horizon disruption at the destination, and schedule context (departure time and month). Weather added value but ranked below turnaround and propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tBring in live, time-aligned weather and nowcasts at the airport level.\n",
    "\t2.\tFix and audit joins so every feature reflects only what is known at prediction time.\n",
    "  3.  Gather more aircraft data (covering potential technical issues)."

    "### Predictions on 2020-2021 Flights\n",
    "\n",
    "The following work represents predicted departure delays for the two \"future\" years 2020 and 2021. Since the model pipeline is trained on data before 2019, data after then is relabeled to 2020 and 2021. These 2 years are unseen categories for our model, meaning the random forest regression model used to rpedict these values maps unseen categories to the same \"other\" bucket, resulting in 2020 and 2021 becoming nearly identical to the model since there was no other way for unsupervised learning to differentiate this information. There are caveats with this, along with potential solutions for how to resolve each. If we use real future data, the model can make proper predictions rather than almost blindly guessing. Given our time frame this was not fully explored. We can also involve proper encoding of the field year, as well as explore fine tuning this model once the previous 2 suggestions are implemented. The following chart is best interpreted as a carrier ranking rather than a true year over year change in predictions. \n",
